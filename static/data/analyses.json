      "what_it_shows": "Monthly trade counts and contract volumes on Kalshi from mid-2021 through late 2025. The platform saw exponential growth, especially around major events like elections and economic data releases. The top chart shows raw trade frequency; the bottom shows total contracts — a proxy for dollar-denominated volume.",
      "takeaways": "Kalshi's growth has been explosive: from a handful of trades in 2021 to millions per month by 2025. Most \"No\" outcomes outnumber \"Yes\" ~3:1, which makes sense — many markets ask \"Will X unlikely thing happen?\" and the answer is usually no. The 7.3M resolved markets give us a massive sample for testing calibration and bias.",

      "description": "The most fundamental test in prediction markets: if a contract trades at 70 cents (implying 70% probability), does the event actually happen ~70% of the time? Perfect calibration means all points land on the diagonal.",
      "what_it_shows": "Each dot represents a price level (1–99 cents). The x-axis is the contract price (implied probability), the y-axis is how often contracts at that price actually won. The dashed gold line is perfect calibration. Points above it mean the market was underpricing the event; points below mean it was overpricing.",
      "takeaways": "Overall, Kalshi markets are remarkably well-calibrated in the 20–80 cent range — prices genuinely reflect probabilities. But at the extremes (especially 1–10 cents), points fall below the diagonal: cheap contracts win even less than their price implies. This is the \"longshot bias\" we dig into next.",

      "takeaways": "A 1-cent contract implies a 1% chance, but historically resolves \"Yes\" far less than 1% of the time.
