Calibration checks whether reality matches that claim. A perfectly calibrated market would have all points fall exactly on a 45-degree diagonal line.

This gives us a DISTRIBUTION of outcomes — showing not just the average, but the worst-case drawdowns, the probability of going broke, and how sensitive results are to bet sizing.
